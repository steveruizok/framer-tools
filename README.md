# Usage (wtf? version)

If you're new to working in the terminal, here are some expanded instructions.

- This tool uses NodeJs. If you don't have Node installed, start by grabbing a copy here [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). If you're not sure, open the Terminal (Applications > Utilities > Terminal) and type `node -v`.

Now that you have node installed, you'll want to install the framer-tools package.

- Open a new Terminal window (Applications > Utilities > Terminal)
- Type `npm i -g framer-tools` and hit enter

Ok, framer-tools is installed. Let's give it a trial run.

- Create a new Framer X project
- Save your project
- Open the project's folder (File > Show Project Folder)
- Now open the terminal again
- Type `cd` (thats `cd` with a space after it) but don't hit enter yet
- Drag the folder named "container" from Finder into the terminal window.

The command line should look something like `cd /Users/username/Library/... /container`

- Hit enter
- Type `framer-tools` and hit enter again
